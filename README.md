# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon

In this study, a machine learning model was developed for predicting bike sharing demand using autogluon, a library for automated machine learning. A regression model was first trained on the original train dataset, then on a dataset with additional features, with hyperparameters optimization, and with model-specific hyperparameters optimization. The model trained on the dataset with additional features had a significant score improvement from 1.79702 to 0.57313 on Kaggle. Despite positive expectations about the hyperparameter optimization, the model had a worse score, but using a model-specific hyperparameter optimization improved the model score from 0.57313 to 0.53222. This result demonstrates that spending more time on hyperparameter optimization could improve the model even better.
